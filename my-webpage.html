        <h2>Sao Paulo</h2>
        <p>Sao Paulo is among the world's most popular cities with numerous cultural institutions and a rich
            architechtural tradition.Sao Paulo has the second highest Human Development Index(HDI)and GDP per capita,the
            fourth lowest rate of illiteracy among the federative units of Brazil being by far,the safest state in the
            country. With more than 46million inhabitantsin 2019,Sao Paulo is the most populus Brazilian state.
        </p>
        <p>The city itself sits in a shallow basin with low mountains to the west. It lies about 220 miles (350 km) southwest 
            of Rio de Janeiro and about 30 miles (50 km) inland from its Atlantic Ocean port of Santos. The city’s name derives 
            from its having been founded by Jesuit missionaries on January 25, 1554, the anniversary of the conversion of St. Paul.</p>
        <p> Only when coffee became Brazil’s vital export crop in the last decades of the 19th century did São Paulo become a major centre
             of economic activity with concomitant population growth. Migration, both from Europe and internal, led to great expansion and diversification.
              When São Paulo served as the main focus of Brazil’s industrialization in the early decades of the 20th century, it rapidly closed the gap with Rio de Janeiro, 
              which shortly before the turn of the century had been 10 times as large.
